# odin-recipes
This will be my first ever coding project applying the knowledge I gathered from The Odin Project until now. 
I expect having a lot of errors which is normal since I'm still learning. 
By the end of the project I want to be able to have everything working fine so I can revisit the project eventually and make it look better with CSS.
